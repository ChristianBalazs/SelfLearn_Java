		//Iterations (or loops) allow to repeat a block of code until a specified condition is met.
		
		//There are three main loop types in Java:
			// while()-loop
			// do()-while()-loop
			// for()-loop
		
		
		//1. While loop
		// while (condition) {code to execute};				
		//Example - While.java
		
		
		
		//2. Do While loop
		// do {code to execute} while (condition);		
		//Example - DoWhile.java
		
		
		
		//3. For loop
		// for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {code to execute}
		// statements separated by (;)
		// Example - ForLoop.java
		
		
		// There is also For Each Loop - used exclusively to loop through elements in an array
		// Example - ForEach.java
		
		
		
		
		//Transfer and Control - manipulate the flow of code with KEYWORDS:
		
		// break - break out of the current code block, 
		// in loops - will skip the rest of the loop and move onto executing the rest of the code.
		
		// continue - break out of the current iteration of a code block, 
		// in loops - will skip the current iteration of the code block and move onto the next.
		
		//return - used in methods to return values according to the methods return type, ending the method.
		
		//Example: - BreakContinue.java
